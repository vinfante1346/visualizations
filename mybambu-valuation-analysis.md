---

## Alternative Valuation: Active Customer Focus

Many acquirers value **active customers** more highly than dormant accounts.

### Active Customer Premium Model

**Monthly Active Customers:** 130,000

| Valuation Tier | Per Active Customer | Total Valuation |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Conservative | $1,500 | **$195M** |
| Moderate | $3,000 | **$390M** |
| Aggressive | $5,000 | **$650M** |

**Why active customers command premium:**
- Actually generating revenue
- Lower churn risk
- Higher LTV (Lifetime Value)
- Better engagement = better monetization

---

## Revenue Multiple Approach

Typical fintech valuations: **8-15x Annual Revenue**

**Assumptions:**
- ARPU (Annual Revenue Per User): $50-150/year
- 130K active customers × $100 ARPU = $13M annual revenue

| Multiple | Valuation |
|----------|-----------|
| 8x | $104M |
| 10x | $130M |
| 12x | $156M |
| 15x | $195M |

---

## LTV/CAC Multiple Approach

Strong LTV/CAC ratio indicates healthy business economics:

**MyBambu CAC:** $35 (blended)
**Industry Standard LTV:** $150-400 (for neobanks)

| LTV | LTV/CAC Ratio | Valuation Multiplier |
|-----|---------------|---------------------|
| $150 | 4.3x | Solid |
| $250 | 7.1x | Strong |
| $400 | 11.4x | Exceptional |

**Valuation Formula:** (Total Customers × LTV) × Quality Multiplier

| Scenario | LTV | Total Value | Quality Multiplier | Final Valuation |
|----------|-----|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Conservative | $150 | $99M | 2.5x | **$248M** |
| Moderate | $250 | $165M | 3.0x | **$495M** |
| Aggressive | $400 | $264M | 3.5x | **$924M** |
