# MyBambu October 2025 Analysis
## Part 10: Compliance, Risk & Fraud

**Analysis Period:** October 1-31, 2025
**Prompt:** 10 of 11

---

## OBJECTIVE
Analyze fraud detection, financial losses, compliance metrics, KYC/AML performance, chargebacks, and account security to assess risk management effectiveness.

---

## 1. FRAUD & SECURITY

### Fraud Detection Metrics
- **Fraud attempts detected** (count)
- **Fraud attempts blocked** (successfully prevented)
- **Fraud detection rate**
  - Formula: (Detected fraud / Total fraud attempts) × 100
  - Target: >95%
- **False positive rate** (legitimate transactions flagged as fraud)
  - Formula: (False positives / Total flagged) × 100
  - Target: <5%

### Fraud Losses
- **Total fraud losses** (USD value of successful fraud)
- **Fraud loss rate**
  - Formula: (Fraud losses / Total transaction volume) × 100
  - Industry benchmark: <0.05% (5 basis points)
- **Average loss per fraud incident**

### Fraud Type Breakdown
| Fraud Type | Incidents | Losses (USD) | % of Total Losses |
|------------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Account takeover** (ATO) | ? | ? | ? |
| **Card fraud** (unauthorized card use) | ? | ? | ? |
| **Identity theft** (fake accounts) | ? | ? | ? |
| **First-party fraud** (user-initiated) | ? | ? | ? |
| **BambuPay fraud** (P2P scams) | ? | ? | ? |
| **Phishing/social engineering** | ? | ? | ? |
| **Chargeback fraud** (friendly fraud) | ? | ? | ? |
| **Other** | ? | ? | ? |

## 2. CHARGEBACKS

Chargebacks occur when users dispute card transactions with their bank.

### Chargeback Metrics
- **Total chargebacks** (count)
- **Total chargeback value** (USD)
- **Chargeback rate**
  - Formula: (Chargebacks / Total card transactions) × 100
  - Industry threshold: <1% (card networks penalize above this)
- **Chargeback win rate** (disputes won by MyBambu)
  - Formula: (Won disputes / Total chargebacks) × 100

### Chargeback Reason Breakdown
| Chargeback Reason | Count | Value (USD) | % of Chargebacks |
|-------------------|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **Fraudulent transaction** | ? | ? | ? |
| **Product/service not received** | ? | ? | ? |
| **Duplicate charge** | ? | ? | ? |
| **Unauthorized charge** | ? | ? | ? |
| **Processing error** | ? | ? | ? |

## 3. ACCOUNT TAKEOVER (ATO) ATTEMPTS

Account takeover is when fraudsters gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

### ATO Detection Metrics
- **ATO attempts detected** (count)
- **ATO attempts blocked** (successfully prevented)
- **Successful ATO incidents** (fraudster gained access)
- **ATO success rate**
  - Formula: (Successful ATOs / Total ATO attempts) × 100
  - Target: <1%

### ATO Indicators

  - Accounts with 5+ failed logins in 24 hours
- **Suspicious device changes** (new device logins)
- **Location anomalies** (login from unusual location)
- **Credential stuffing attempts** (using leaked passwords)

### ATO Response Time
- **Average time to detect ATO** (from first suspicious activity)
- **Average time to lock compromised account**
- **Average time to restore account to legitimate user**
